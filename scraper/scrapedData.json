      "I ordered this device because there was an issue in signal reception of another Samsung A series device. Got the A15 5G and it was able to get the signal reception and the phone is superb. Packing was sealed well and delivered very professionally by the Amazon delivery person.",
      "Very bad experience with this phone.  I Purchased this phone on 30.03.2024. And from next day it was hanging badly. And This was the condition when there was there was no extra data in the phone.  After 02 days I had gone to customer service centre for this. They told me that in this mobile there is some software problem and they are getting many complaint from customers. I had told them to replace the phone but they denied that there is no return policy for software problem and mobile phone can be replacewhen there is hardware problem. After updating software from service center When I asked if there is still hangs problem they told me that i have to go to them again.So I have to say that if anyone want to purchase this phone then be ready to feel like you are robbed.If you are planning to buy this phone then i suggest to purchase other company or other mobile set.This was the worst purchase deal for me",

Eventually, it will be enabled, is what they say.You have to go and change the settings to enable fast charging.'Accidental touch' protection doesn't work as intended.",

      "👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,",
      "Buen teléfono con batería duradera.",

      "Sono super felice di questo acquisto! Avevo prima il samsung m31, questo è ancora meglio, la batteria dura quasi 2 giorni. Lo schermo è ottimo, facilissimo da trasferire i dati da uno all'altro. Veloce nei caricamenti",
      "Es gab keinen Ladegerät in der Handyverpackung, das war bei der Bestellung nicht ersichtlich, man konnte aus der Beschreibung nicht nachvollziehen.",

      "👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,",

      "Really good phone,I expected a laggy phone but its fast. The file transfer time compared to my oneplus 7t is too much. Good for the price though,fast for everyday use,I don't game so no worries for me.Camera is bad,expected better.takes worse pics than my oneplus 7t.Doesnt have telephoto too.Main cam is OK.and also there's a useless macro cam. Don't buy if your priority is camera.Performance- fast for everyday use.social media,web browsing ans stuff.Never felt laggy. Don't think it's good for gaming,I don't game so I don't know.Battery- battery is really good. First few days I felt it was draining fast,but now it lasts a really long time.Charging- charges from 5-85% in 50-55mins,I don't charge past 85 for battery health.Screen- screen is actually very big and also it's super ambled,very nice screen.UI- oneui is amazing. So many features. Bixby is good too.Speaker- just wow.Very impressive. Really loud and good clarity tooConclusion- I got it for 27,350 , buy it if you want a phone with 4 years os updates,no other brands offer this many updated at this price. Don't buy if you are looking for an impressive camera or a gaming phone.",
      "First and foremost I would like to say that there is nothing great about this smartphone. What I mean is this is a jack of all trades kind of thing.1. Design and display - Look wise this thing is a beauty. Weight is slightly higher than what I would like but not a deal breaker. That nipple notch people complain about is not even an issue as your brain automatically gets used to it fairly quickly.Coming to display this is my first samsung phone and as everyone says samsung panels are the best and they are not wrong. Sharpness is great,colors produced are excellent and black and whites are rich and detailed all the way. Brightness is more than good enough for both outdoor use and use in dark room at night as it does get very dim so your eyes don't strain as much.2. Camera - Both rear and front produce really good photo and video quality given the lighting conditions are good. Low light quality is decent enough. Photos come out a little saturated but nothing over the top. Although sometimes I feel there is a slight shutter lag when there are lots of details in the frame. Front camera produces ample details and good skin tones.3. Performance- There is no lag in the UI or any heavy apps . Everything runs buttery smooth provided 120hz refresh rate setting is always on. I did some casual gaming and there were no frame drops or jitters whatsoever.  Also I would like to add if you want to go for heavy gaming you would want to go to game launcher settings and turn high performance mode and also a setting that turns on high frame rate with touch controls. All in all this is more than good enough for 90% of things you throw at it.4. Battery - After reading many mixed reviews I was quite skeptical about battery life but man was I proven wrong. After finishing setup and installing 30plus apps I full charged my phone and did a complete one day (24hrs)heavy usage to check battery life . I easily got 8plus SOT on mixed 5g and wifi ,screen brightness ranging from 30-80%. Usage ranged from social media, YouTube, camera , some games, phone customization and both network and whatsapp calls. Battery idle drain is also very minimal.5. Speakers - This is where things get weird. Don't get me wrong the sound is Rich loud and dare I say brilliant.  But there is one issue.  Whenever you turn Dolby atmos on and keep volume around 40% the back panel near the bottom will vibrate and its the annoying kind of vibrations. I tried with a case but there was not much difference. You need to learn to hold slightly differently or ignore it.6. Price - After coupons and bank offers I got a pretty good deal and feel like this is a value for money phone. (Avoid it if you get it around 28k or more.)7. Charging- There is no charger provided so add another 1k to your total budget.  Charging while on the slow side comparatively a 25 W samsung charger takes around 25 minutes to go from 20-85% which is the range we should be charging our phones anyway to make the batteries working life as long as possible so charging time is not an issue for me personally .8. Network - Network seems to be good enough on both 5g ,LTE and wifi. No call drops or voice breaks whatsoever. Internet speeds are very good as well.9. Fingerprint sensor - This is another area which has annoyed me . Setting up fingerprints is easy but very rarely it just behaves like a stubborn child and doesn't want to work at all. I needed to restart the device  two times which fixed the issue. Otherwise most of the times it's reliable( works 9/10 attempts) and decently fast ( takes .75 seconds approximately).This is it guys . All in all a good device with very few compromises. Heavy gamers should look elsewhere though.  I would update review after a major update is available. Thank you.",
      "I got this for 18.5k after exchanging my RN7 pro. It's been a month that i have been using and totally satisfied with what it has to offer. Camera is fine, no lags, mediatek processor does its duty, have tried asphalt and COD. Feels premium to hold, looks like a flagship. Fast charging is good, takes 90 minsOnly con is battery backup, it drains if you are a heavy user, warms a bit and also you need to buy the charger(25W) separatelyBuy it if you want to carry a branded premium looking smartphone with above decent performance, it won't disappoint.",
      "Good mid range phone if you don't want to spend much on flagships. Downside is feels little bulky and heavy but also feels sturdy. No issues with performance for everyday tasks. Better option if you don't trust Chinese brands. Decent battery backup lasts for a day. It has samsung wallet makes upi payments easier. Secure folder is also a great feature for having private data and you can also have hidden apps like WhatsApp inside secure folder. Minimum bloatware on oneui but you can disable it. Camera looked good compared to my old oneplus 7t. Overall good purchase."

      "This is not a review but a rant.I cannot simply understand why Samsung with all its superb UI and software updates has to compromise on the hardware by providing Exynos line chipsets.The chipset makes photography inconsistent overall. A below average low light photography performance, inconsistent shots and image processing.The phone heats up much more compared to my three year old Galaxy A71 that has a Snapdragon 730.45K for a top of the line variant and an Exynos chipset is not how you treat one of your biggest Smartphone markets of the world.If only Sumsung provided 8 Gen 1 with this device with a price between 45-50K, this could have been the smartphone of the year. The Qualcomm chipset would have handled the heating, image processing and battery management much better and would have held up really well in the long run as Samsung is going to provide 4 years of OS upgrades on this.This phone would feel warm, even for users like our parents, who spend most of their time on YouTube or Facebook watching Short Videos and Reels. This shouldn't be happening in a device that's worth 45K in today's market.I don't even want to bring Gaming and Video Editing or rendering into this conversation.If you want a decent smartphone for light social media consumption, music, 5G, good display and good software and getting good offers on this smartphone, then go for it. Otherwise it doesn't make any sense.This is probably the last time I have bought Samsung that has an Exynos chipset. I have always loved this brand, my first phone being Samsung Metro 5200. But they are not making any effort to like them anymore.I hope GOI like USA takes on Samsung for selling below par products in our country at ridiculous prices.Peace out. 🌸🙏🏼",
      "The exynos processor inside A55 has AMD GPU which is far superior than the mali gpu present in previous generations.Pros:Display,  smoothness, one ui, camera(i luv it), processor,  5000mah battery, software update promise.Cons:Charging speed.As of now didn't face any lag or shutter. Will update here if I face any.",
      "Heating",

      "It's been 15 days since i using the device extensively.I bought it on the Last freedom sale for Rs. 41,999 ( including 6k instant discount coupon).First let me be clear , I bought ' S20 FE 5G 'with Snapdragon 865 , not ' S20 FE with Exynos ' and i am a user who uses phone most of the time .This review may be long but it's worth to read it if you're buying this product.Let me divide between the Pros and Cons.First i would like like to start with Pros of the Device ,Pros :1. Display :Samsung has been already popular for it's AMOLED Displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here . They might have got some defective Piece. I have no issues with my display . It's been long time i saw a great display like this ... with 120Hz it is Super Smooth.Also , it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions ( PS : No tint issues )The in display finger print scanner is very fast and didn't faced any issues with it .2. Stereo Speakers :As an extensive multimedia user , this is one of the most favorable feature for me.Believe me , you can't find any other device with such great Sound quality in this price segment , it's almost like flagship devices ..Both the speakers are adequately loud.3. Battery :As a person who's shifting from a normal 60Hz Device phone , i was very worried about the battery life of this device at 120Hz but it surprised me very well ..Initially i thought i would need to switch to 60Hz for better battery life for daily usage.But I didn't even thought this device would give this much great battery life at 120Hz.At 120Hz , I am getting around 7 hours of minimum SOT ( Screen on Time ).The maximum SOT i got at 120Hz is 9Hours 13 minutes.I didn't checked battery life at 60Hz because i didn't use it at 60Hz even a single day . The battery life is Excellent.4. Rear Cameras :I am not a very good photographer or something , i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally.I was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well..Added Some Camera Samples above ( Pic 1 : Ultrawide , Pic 2 : Telephoto [ Pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading )Both the three Cameras ( Primary + Ultrawide + Telephoto ) performs very well.If you're a camera guy you should definitely check this out.5. Performance & RAM Management :I'm not a gamer , I use my device for daily usage of social media , ott platforms , Calls , messages etc. but i use it extremely.I didn't faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now.Also ,Ram management of the Device is excellent , I am a person who uses 4-5 appsbackground at single time and i didn't have any issues of closing down the apps .6. ONE UI :I was a stock Android guy , but One UI actually surprised me , it is very well optimised and very user-friendly for single hand usage..initial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one Ui but I'm now got used to it.PS : I didn't found any kind of ads on my device as i didn't sign up or used any samsung Apps.7. Build Quality :Even though its back is made up of plastic , the overall build quality is super Premium the Aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device..8. Future Proof :  The device has 9 5G Bands , IP68 Rating , Wireless Charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket.IP68 & Wireless Charging are mostly only found on Flagship Devices . Its good to see samsung brings it at lower price.This is the best future proof device as of now.So these are the Major pros i noticed as of now .Now let's move to the Cons.Cons :1. NO HDR SUPPORT ON NETFLIX :  As an extensive multimedia user , i found it very frustrating. even mid range devices offering HDR support on Netflix , Samsungs Flagship Killer doesn't have HDR support.IT WILL NOT BE FIXED VIA OTA UPDATE .2. No 256GB Variant :  This is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses Dual sim , i found it little difficult.But if you're a single sim user , luckily it have hybrid solution ..so you can use a Sim card + expandable memory card ...3. Gorilla Glass 3 :  Other competitors are providing atleast GG5 in this price range. But S20 FE 5G has just GG3 ( Which also I'm not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere ).But at the end of the day , GLASS IS GLASS & IT WILL BROKE.4. No headphone Jack :  It is not any kind of unusual thing .most of the phones above 30K segment doesn't have headphone jack.So we have to buy 3.5mm to Type C adapter , type c earphones or bluetooth solutions .Note : Only Buy original Samsung type c adapter else it may not support.5. No 25W charger :  It is not actually a con for me as i prefer Low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage .but it may be a con for you ,  Although the device supports 25W charging . Only 15W charger is provided inside the box .. They should have given 25W inside the box.I didn't have any issues with 15W charger but it would be great if they bundle it with 25W as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed.For the reference of Charging speed ,Both 15W & 25W will full charge the device almost at the same time but using 25W you can get about 50% within 30 minutes where as 30% with 15W charger.Full charge time i usually takes is 1hour and 35 minutes.6. Front Camera :  I am not a selfie guy , but if you're a person who's looking for a selfie device just don't buy it . it's not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but it's not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price rangeCONCLUSION :If you're a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life , great rear cameras , great performance , better software support , better build quality and use it for more than 3 years & the cons mentioned above doesn't bother youJust buy it , I am sure you won't be disappointed.",
      "pros-1) CAMERAS- almost flagship level quality, no nonsensical cameras, almost all flagship features, manageable cutout2) DESIGN- it's simple matt finish design; not clumsy and shining like most phones now a days3) FEATURES- almost all flagship level features incl. IP 68, wireless charging, etc.4) CUSTOMIZATION- insane level of customisation any phone can do. it'll take weeks to try all CUSTOMIZATION features for normal users5) light weight6) SPEED- earlier samsung used to be slow but now a days ONE UI has changed the picture, especially this one is SD 865; no heating issues as such for average users.plus 120 hz display with S-AMOLED feels so fast and smooth like butter7) most of the bloatwares can be deleted8) SOUND- enough for day to day task+ dolby atmos feels so awesome bcs of stereo speakers9) SOFT. UPDATES- almost each month. samsung has now become the king in software update10) 5G- it's 5g ready with enough band unlike most phones with 1-2  bands.CONS-1) battery back-up- average( though can be managed throughout the day for average users)2) average battery back-up coupled with average charging speed3) night mode isn't working after the update4) the chin is noticeableCONCLUSION-plastic back( though very good quality and seems glass), little bezels, etc is understandable for me as this is almost flagship level phone with mid range level price tag. i got it @below 30k+ card disc. which is such a respectable price tag for this phone. no other phone(even 2022 released phone) can stand a chance in this price range.believe me if you're no frills, logical person who understands the real use of a smartphone, this phone is for you.otherwise, there're phones with 5-6 cameras and 8 inch displays  with 7k power batteries with no actual use and average quality like oneplus now a days.also, i ignored s21 fe bcs of EXYNOS and design.Enjoy the precious life.  ***edit- night mode issue solved after update",
      "To correct  my review, the placement of the sim and memory disk happens in the same slot.  The 2 are placed back to back in the holder.  Hope this helps.I'm very happy with this phone."

      "👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,",

      "I'm using this mobile for 7 days. This phone is great at this price range,, it's camera is also awesome,, also it's a well multitasking phone for everyday users but you've to keep in mind that this is not a gaming phone but light games or free fire plays well without any lags,, after playing 30 mins there you can find a slight framedrop,, it's battery is just superb,, after charging of 100% the battery can last longer up to 30 hrs. according to my usage. At the end it carries Samsung's brand value which is the best thing. But the adapter/back case is not provided by the company in the mobile box. There is also a missing thing that is the phone does not wear any screen protector. So after buying your smartphone you've to purchase your back case/screen guard for the safety purpose. Otherwise it's the best budget 5G phone under 12K.",
      "The phone was in very good condition and the prices were very competitive as compared to other websites. Also services are also good and it is working fine. Thankyou for such a wonderful experience.",

      "Phone is average. Speed is OK. Could been faster. Phone is lagging after few months of usage. Sometimes incoming calls gets hanged up. Battery stays for 1 day. If we use internet and calls, battery drains within half day. Phone gets heated up very frequently. If outside it heats pretty quick",
      "Okish product, cannot be used for heavy activity. Phone even with 8GB RAM feels a bit slow in performance. Call quality is choppy sometimes. Recommended for people above 50, who use phone for minimal purposes like calls, WhatsApp, YouTube. Cannot expect games / heavy apps to run smoothly.Plenty of ads, can be removed with customisation."

The colour beautifully jells with the green S23 Ultra. The buttons are pretty tactile and very well made of good quality material.The additional camera cover, which is removable, is totally genius and protects the most important part of the phone in a clean and aesthetic way.The grip is just ok and when used inside airconditioned rooms can be a bit slippery.Overall among the best suited cases for S23 Ultra that gives you a neat and clean profile.",
      "The case is really nice with good build quality and finish. The colour is accurate to images and the camera slider works decent enough for a plastic piece.What I loved the most is how the case is sturdy yet soft which allows the phone to sit nice and snug inside the case.",
      "Have been using the case for close to a year and can easily say that it is a great case. I've dropped my phone several times (on road, floors, etc.) and there's no damage to even the case yet. It looks as good as new.The only downside is that it makes your phone look a bit boxy, which I am personally okay with because I am a rough user and would prefer not protection over making it look nice.",
      "Very nice product for s23ultra.. perfect fit.. provides max. protection.. feels like a ultra premium product..looks like cover integrated with mobile as olden period nokia n79...",
      "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n            \n                \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n     I never thought I would be spending so much money on a case. I was very hesitant. The phone was a gift so never really had phone worth more than 20k. I didn't have confidence on myself that I would be careful in handling the phone since I am not used to. So spent a lot of money in buying the best case, lens protector and screen protector.Even with the lens protector on, I can still use this case with ease. Unlike other cases which I looked at in a store near my home.The sliding lens cover is very important for me because I have big hands and very frequently my finger kept touching the bottom lens without me being aware of it.When you open or close the sliding lid, it's locks itself in place so it's not gonna move while clicking pics or when the phone is in ur pocket.I have been using for around 2 months now. No issue at all. I have dropped my phone once already. Just a small crack on the screen guard and nothing else.The phone might seem a little bulky but It doesn't bother me at all. I want it to be safe more than anything. Infact due to its bulky size people easily notice it and enquire about which phone it is. Gives me an opportunity to show off ;D.Wireless charging and reverse wireless charging works even with the case on. No problem. Never faced any over heating issues or something. Definitely it heats up a little while charging but that's expected while charging with 65 watt charger.",
      "Light weight, looks good,  expensive, fairly durable , screen has only side protection , fairly grip",
      "This product is amazing, fits properly with S23 ultra with every cut made pricesely, it must be use without the temperd glass bit if you have screen Protector this product works fine with it",
      "You will read many review which say that case cannot be used with a gaurd. I read those too, but still bought the case. Just to find that all those comments were true. Do not buy this case if you want to use screen gaurd UV or silicon one.Apart from that, case quality is good, buy only if some offer is applicable. Not worth the MRP. I bought it at 2100₹",
      "Produto muito bom!",
      "La funda  si cubre bien al teléfono, no interfiere  con el sonido ni con el cargador  cosa que se agradece. La tapa que cubre las camaras no se atora al momento  de moverla. Buen diseño y colores.",
      "This is a great case - sturdy and protective.  I LOVE the slider.Pros:1. Camera lens protection (of course)2. Sturdy3. button response4. parallel edge - the edge of the case feels almost part of the phone itself.  It makes sliding out side-menus very comfortableThere are a few niggles, some have nothing to do with Spigen.1. Samsung made the camera lenses very large, bringing them down somewhat parallel to the qi wireless receiver. That means you can't add a mount (for example \"oh snap\") to this case because the slider is right in the way.2. In fact, it's hard to adequately put any sizable mount on it because you have to mount it further down on the case and the phone is heavy enough that if you magnetically mount it (eg in a car), it may spin down/off the mount.3. Samsung put the buttons on the right side of the phone, so when you use it in your right hand and go to thumb the buttons, your forefinger might end up all over the bottom lens!4. You can't fit a glass lens protector under the slider as the tolerance is too tight.In the end, I kept the case but also got the Spigen Rugged Armor - with zero protection for the camera lens. It's another great case.",
      "4.5 stars, pretty close to perfect. It has a super nice textured bit on the back that I kind of wish wrapped around the whole phone (or at least the lower part where you hold it, for added grip). Still, it's a great case and having the slide cover to protect the lenses is a feature that I won't ever go without for several reasons:-it protects the lenses from impacts (they are pricey and/or difficult to replace; glass lens covers potentially reduce image quality)-it keeps the lenses clean so you're ready for a photo whenever-it makes me feel more comfortable having my phone out in public places; We all know there are creeps out there so I appreciate that people won't have to worry that I'm one of them, recording without consent.Highly recommend this for the S23 ultra or variations of it for whatever phone you have.",
      "Je cherchais une coque qui protège les objectifs de l'appareil photo correctement. La  coque est de bonne manufacture. La protection pour l'appareil photo est très pratique. Je n'ai pas testé si elle est compatible avec la recharge sans fil."
