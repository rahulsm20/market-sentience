      "Thank you Amazon for quick delivery. I was looking initially in Aptronix stores for Indigo Alpine loop Ultra2 model but couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere near. I booked in Amazon and I got it within a day. It‚Äôs original and I am happily satisfied with the packaging.Coming to watch , I come from watch7 series and I noticed huge improvement in battery life though screen size looks almost same as mine was 45mm previously.  The watch is little pricey as we will get iPhone 15 with that price but if you are willing to keep it for next 5 years it‚Äôs really worth every penny. Look and touch wise is excellent as it comes with titanium metal and sapphire display. I have buyed spigen armor case because I didn‚Äôt took apple care and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs needed because the watch itself is armor heavy protective and it can take heavy beating and wear regularly. I highly recommend Amazon services and ultra2 if you are willing to spend money and need best smart watch.",

      "Upgraded from Series 3. Totally in love with Ultra.Update after 3 months:After 3 months of usage, I'm glad I picked Ultra over Series 8. I bumped it into doors, walls, tables and whatnot on numerous occasions and not a single scratch on screen or a dent to the body. Solid 2 day battery life. Lightweight design. Definitely one of my best purchases from Apple.Starlight band gets dirty quickly. I often wash it once a week. I recommend darker colours for the band.Prologue:I wanted to upgrade from Series 3 as I purchased it almost 5 years ago and it stopped getting watchOS updates. Battery has taken a hit, display was full of scratches and colour started chipping away from the body.At first I was inclined to go with Series 8 midnight Aluminium 45mm GPS + LTE. I was convinced that it's a better choice as it weighs light and doesn't look as bulky as Ultra as I have skinny wrists. And I almost bought it from online Apple store.Then I started going through the reviews for Ultra and it slowly grew on me. I liked the idea of having a better battery. Sapphire glass + Titanium body = fewer scratches and dents in the long run. And I plan to use the watch for next 4-5 years. Although by no means I'm an extreme user that Apple says this watch is for, it turned out to be a no brainer to get Ultra over Series 8. Display is big. Battery life is better. Build quality is durable. Lasts longer on cellular if I wanted to switch off my iPhone for a few days for fewer distractions.I went ahead and placed the order on Amazon. Stock was available and I could get the watch faster than from the online Apple store. Got it delivered under a week.Impressions after a week's usage:I'm very happy with the purchase. I'm getting two days of battery life with an hour of workout each day and 8 hours of sleep tracking. Display is crisp and accommodates more content. Siren is fun to play with.However the concern is with the Starlight alpine loop band. Band already got dirty. And I developed a mild rash as my wrists were used to silicone bands with series 3 and not accustomed to polyester in alpine loop band. However they subsided in a day. Soon I'm planning to get a solo braided loop preferably in a dark colour.So, if you can afford it, I definitely recommend it over Series 8. Better battery, build quality and bigger display are the things that you will enjoy.",

No. But am I enjoying it having bought it? Absolutely Yes! Previously had galaxy watch 4. It‚Äôs battery used to die out within half a day. This watch is a beast. Solid two days on average use and more if you tweak appropriately.Is size big? Not at all. Personally I feel it‚Äôs super optimum for any smartwatch for proper reading or interaction.Yellow is an odd colour to choose. But, the colour in real life suits better than I imagined from official pics. Also wanted non standard colour and issue with size of alpine loop is circumvented if we choose this band (durability as well)I bought a ringke case and spigen tempered glass ‚Äî- Yoyubers say that applying these is unnecessary but my mind is at peace after applying. Maybe I will throw them one day and just enjoy the bareness of ultraness.GPS and cellular connectivity is superb, no compromise on any aspect!If you need to compare it, u need to compare wid iwatch 8 steel cellular. Given price diff is less , ultra wins. Don‚Äôt compare wid iwatch 8 gps AL. This watch is way ahead in durability than that.Best wishes.",
      "I was planning from last 6 months to buy this but not sure about this product with huge price.But after i bought, i can say that1) its battery life is amazing with always on display which is far far better than watch 8/9.2) its build up quality which is unbelievable.3) Weight of the product is little bit higher than the others.4) 49 mm size can be shows bigger if u have not thicker wrist.",
      "Titanium as it goes is really durable. Been using it for a year and not even a single scratch till date",
      "I have purchased a Apple Watch ultra yesterday and it is not working now they are saying to visit the Apple Store, why you guys don‚Äôt understand we trust your service and you guys making us to not trust you, I don‚Äôt have time to visit the Apple service Center and why I visit it if the product is received from your side and not working it‚Äôs your responsibility.- This is a kind of scam with us and next time I will make sure that me or my known peoples should purchase from other alternatives",
      "V good build quality. Worth the money. You should have atleast 1 high quality smart watch in your collection",
      "Unless you are person leading a very active outdoors life this watch won‚Äôt give you anything more than a non ultra Apple Watch can provide for half the cost..That being said it looks cool enough for some of us to justify the cost.The battery life is good  to excellent depending on the functions you leave on.. turning off the always on display increases battery life from 30 hrs to 4  days.",
      "You must have IOS 16+ which iPhone 8 and above. If tunes perfectly it can run almost about 2 days without a charge, Family setup is not supported by the carriers in India. Very convenient as you can leave the phone behind without having worried about getting disconnected from family. Complicated health app and takes some time to reach to the point which suits you best. ECG is inbuilt. Lot of inbuilt or App store faces does not support real time health information except basic movements."

The Starlight Aluminium Case adds a touch of elegance and durability, while the Starlight Sport Band is comfortable to wear for extended periods. The watch fits perfectly on my wrist, and I appreciate the option to switch bands easily, allowing me to match my watch to any occasion.Battery life is impressive considering the watch's capabilities. With moderate use, I can easily go a full day without needing to recharge. However, it's worth noting that more intensive usage, such as extended workouts with GPS tracking, may require more frequent charging.The seamless integration with my iPhone is another standout feature. I can receive and respond to messages, make calls, and control music playback right from my wrist. The ability to stream music and podcasts directly to the watch without needing my phone is a game-changer during workouts or when I want to enjoy a walk without carrying my phone.In conclusion, the Apple Watch SE GPS 44mm in the Starlight Aluminium Case with Starlight Sport Band is an outstanding smartwatch that delivers on both style and functionality.

Seamless Integration with Apple Ecosystem: Being an Apple product, the Watch SE seamlessly syncs with your iPhone, providing access to a wide range of apps, notifications, and the ability to respond to messages directly from your wrist. It offers a convenient and efficient way to stay connected.Cons:  No Always-On Display: Unlike the higher-end Apple Watch models, the SE does not have an always-on display feature.

However, it still offers an impressive array of fitness tracking capabilities.  Battery Life Could Be Better: The battery life of the Apple Watch SE is decent but not exceptional. With typical usage, you'll need to charge it every day or every other day, which may be a minor inconvenience for some users.",

      "A great product from apple as always. I love this thing . The only thing i don't like is the battery life of it. The battery is horrible. It barely lasts a day but other than that the product is fire. Must buy!!!",
      "Very professional smart watch which does it job as per expectations. 44 mm dial is also impressive. Sync with iphone is fabulous. Two complaints are :-1. Despite being a globally popular brand, No apple watches could connect whatsaap calls with iPhone..Surprisingly all the cheapest smart watches around could do this. Not even Apple Ultra watches could connect whatsapp calls is simply not acceptable from Apple.2. Battery back up could be improved to minimum 2 days. Now it need to be charged every day.Rest it‚Äôs a good buy.",
      "Excellent product",
      "It‚Äôs needless to mention about the product quality as it bears the guarantee of apple but Amazon gave it at an unbelievable price. With all offers I got it for 18450(approx). It‚Äôs the 40mm gps version and that‚Äôs enough for an average user unless you indulge in professional activity. It gives all relevant information that can be expected from a smartwatch in fact a little more with an exceptional accuracy. Only down side this version dose not have the spo2 monitor but then it‚Äôs not required most of the time. Display is adequately bright and legible the size is not a constraint.But Amazon took a bit too long to deliver the item may be due to the sale and even prime didn‚Äôt helpüòÄ. But thanks to Amazon for offering such a quality product at this rate.",
      "Best Smartwatch for the Price during sales with offers ,also because its apple and for those who own iPhones  specially for the young people who  dont need ECG . easy to use, good tracking  on point connectivity with other devices and saves my time to decide even if I need to take out my phone if I receive a call or not by  just a glance on the watch when the phone rings  ! I agree  cellular one  also has its no benefit but in my use I usually dont leave my iPhone behind so no regrets at all for getting the GPS version of the Apple Watch SE",

      "Simple look with basic features.",
      "This is the first time I am using an Apple Watch. After a lot of reviews and comparisons, I finally decided to go for the Apple Watch SE 2023 for:1) The crisp AMOLED display (Always on Display not available) - If you guys need the AOD, please skip this watch.2) Basic Features - As this is my first apple watch, I thought I need to get used to the UI and the gestures so I personally decided to go for the watch that has latest OS and processor with minimal and basic functions. (Blood Oxygen and ECG not available - if that is your priority, please skip this watch)3) Smooth Watch OS - This is by far the best UI I have ever used in a smart watch. Everything looks good, works good and feels good.4) Calling - The call quality in the watch is AMAZING! The user at the other end cannot tell the difference whether you're calling/communicating through your watch or through your phone.5) Accuracy - I heard many reviewers saying that the apple watch is the measuring stick for all tracking (sleep, step, heart rate, etc) and it is indeed true. All the measurements are almost 95% accurate when compared to the high-end measuring devices.Cons:I have been using this watch for the past 2 months and never really found any noticeable cons. If found any, definitely I will update.Overall it is an excellent product compared to other watches. Of course Samsung and Xiaomi offers better features such as AOD, Blood Oxygen Monitor, ECG, etc at a lesser price but still, considering the quality and user experience, definitely I would suggest this Apple Watch SE 2023.I purchased this watch for 25k which is surprising as 44mm SE 2023 at that price range was confusing as 40mm was around 27-28k at that time. I did not see any notable offers but surprisingly, I got this for a low price tag which also makes me adore the purchase I made.",
      "2h charging 100%",
      "Screen is very small",
      "Battery of this watch is terrible I think if apple improve its Battery.",
      "The prices for watch SE and Watch 8 are similar and you can get watch 8 till the stock lastsSo don‚Äôt buy SE , instead buy watch 8"

With moderate use, I can easily go a full day without needing to recharge.

Can be connected with network and all apps including notifications of my phone are coming. Workout and activity rings working properly. Health apps all parameter taking up from my body. ECG, oximeter, Heart bit are functioning very well. Worth it buying at a premium price of Rs.54000/-. Willing to buy one more for my spouse birthday. Fantastic.",

Sport loop is soft and light, in my opinion feels better than the silicon one and is more comfortable to wear while sleeping since I want to track my sleeping routine. On device Siri also seems to be working a tad bit faster and accurate.Battery life is the only area where this particular watch can do better, maybe a 2 day battery will be just perfect.",

I booked in Amazon and I got it within a day. It‚Äôs original and I am happily satisfied with the packaging.Coming to watch , I come from watch7 series and I noticed huge improvement in battery life though screen size looks almost same as mine was 45mm previously.  The watch is little pricey as we will get iPhone 15 with that price but if you are willing to keep it for next 5 years it‚Äôs really worth every penny. Look and touch wise is excellent as it comes with titanium metal and sapphire display. I have buyed spigen armor case because I didn‚Äôt took apple care and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs needed because the watch itself is armor heavy protective and it can take heavy beating and wear regularly. I highly recommend Amazon services and ultra2 if you are willing to spend money and need best smart watch.",
