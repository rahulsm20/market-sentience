Review 1: ['The OnePlus 12 boasts an exceptional battery life, making it a reliable companion throughout the day. The super-fast charging feature proves invaluable for quick top-ups when needed. The display is top-notch, delivering vibrant visuals that enhance the overall user experience.Equipped with Snapdragon Gen 3, the OnePlus 12 ensures seamless performance, effortlessly handling the latest mobile games. While slightly bulky, its ergonomic design becomes comfortable after a brief adjustment period.The camera may not surpass flagship competitors like the S24 Ultra or 15 Max Pro, but it outperforms other phones on the market.

No regrets got 9300 off from the old 5t in exchange benefit. If looking anything between 60-80 k buy this, you won't be disappointed", 'The phone is amazingly smooth, terrific camera, the best screen and battery performance!!! Other pros include haptics, screen brightness, camera module and charging speeds.', "TLDR; Great phone for buyers who are looking for a well-rounded phone which can do a bit of everything, but don't buy it if your top priority is the camera. I have judged the camera harshly because cameras are important in flagships.Display - 7.5/10Camera - 6.5/10Performance - 9/10Software - 8/10Battery - 9.5/10Connectivity - 9/10I upgraded from my OP9R to this and got a nice exchange bonus out of it. I had briefly used a Pixel 8 Pro as well, and while the software and camera were superior than the OP12, their hardware was outdated and I faced a lot of connectivity issues so I ended up returning the P8P.Note: I will say that when it comes to the overall phone experience and my personal requirements, OnePlus 12 is better than Pixel 8 Pro in my opinion and also ₹35k cheaper.This phone is already competitively priced so I got a good deal out of it. Here are my initial impressions -1. ACCESSORIES: Getting a charger and a phone case in 2024 out of the box makes me really happy. The case is okay but I would recommend getting a better one. The charger is big and heavy as it's 100W.2. DISPLAY: The display is - clarity and quality wise fantastic, and any media you play in a higher resolution will look phenomenal. The brightness is also quite ample even under full sunlight conditions. Although 4500 nits is misleading but when you access HDR content, you will witness it's not entirely a gimmick. A display this good at this price is commendable.The display is also CURVED, which is worst thing about it. This is the first curved display phone I've used and it's a bad experience for me. The light glares on the curved parts break the immersion while watching videos or browsing, photo editing can be a pain, causes problems in copy-pasting texts, gathers a lot of dust and not to mention how they are susceptible to more damages even with a good case on. It gets worse in sunlight. It will take some getting used to but I will never like it.3. CAMERA: Camera has good clarity (the 10-bit mode can further enhance picture quality) but is also frustrating at times. There are a lot of moments when it overexposes, over sharpens and messes up the white balance in certain parts of photos after processing. I've had to manually tweak the exposure settings to get the scenes right a lot of times. Rear camera seflies indoors, sky pictures and sceneries with a lot of dynamic range come out weird after processing sometimes. The whole point of Hasselblad tuning is that the photos should be true-to-life. Sometimes pictures come out too warm indoors. Outdoors they perform better. I have had to use the Master Mode on Auto to take some pictures so that the processing does not ruin the picture. The downside of Master Mode is that your photos will end up looking a bit bland (because there's no post-processing happening) and it does not handle dynamic ranges well.QUICK TIP: Turn off the ProXDR mode from the inbuilt gallery settings. It exaggerates photo quality on your display but is useless outside your gallery once you upload those photos somewhere.Night mode is okay and gets the job done but don't expect it to perform a miracle with bad lighting conditions. Portrait mode is fantastic, edge-detection is very well-tuned. The Pro mode is where this camera shines and makes the use of the camera hardware but the majority won't use it. The glass coating on the camera is very susceptible to damage because it covers a better part of your phone's back so you will need to buy a good case.Digital zoom is not very good in my opinion considering IQOO 12 has done a much better job with it while being significantly cheaper.Video recordings from the rear camera come out clear enough and the audio quality is also good. But when you're switching lenses for zooming in, you'll notice a bit of stutter and a slight change in the colour gradient. When you're zooming in a lot, the camera takes 3-5 seconds before registering a focus object and detecting it properly. Super stable mode works well but only with 60fps. 30fps recording mode is not that smooth, with sub-par stabilization and stutters a lot when switching lenses. These have been an ongoing issue for a few generations and one would have expected OP to resolve it by now.Front camera is pretty average (even more disappointing indoors). It works well in daylight but indoor pictures look like they're taken from a mid-range phone. They did tune the front camera to have a wider angle which is good. Video recording from the front camera doesn't allow 60 fps but allows 4K recording now.OP clearly needs to work in the camera department in future updates. Their camera algorithms are quite behind compared to the current industry standards even though the phone has good camera hardware.Overall camera is okay for daily use but if it's your main priority, this phone might not be for you.4. CONNECTIVITY AND CALL QUALITY - Did not notice any call drops, 5G works well and the person on the other end heard my voice very loud and clear. Bluetooth and WIFI are working well.IR blaster works but don't expect it to be compatible with every device. Gets the job done regardless and a super convenient feature that I wish more phones had these days.5. BATTERY AND CHARGING - It is fantastic. Can last a full day on medium to heavy usage, and 1.5 days on light usage. They have also introduced battery health management features which is an added bonus. I had to try really hard to drain the battery completely.Charging time is 25-27 mins after full drainage. The smart charging feature to conserve battery health over time is a nice addition. Haven't used the wireless charging or reverse wireless charging so wouldn't be able to comment on it.My current SOT shows up as almost 9 hrs and 1d 5 hrs since last charge with 7% charge left. Battery is crazy good as you can see.6. PERFORMANCE: Top-notch performance, phone feels super fast and snappy. Got only slightly warm during gaming (I played CoDM), continuous camera operations and charging. Their new cooling system is proving to be very good.Read and write speeds, app installations are also super fast.7. SOFTWARE: Oxygen OS 14 has some very good parts (quick launch, smart sidebar, file docker etc), and some bad parts. There are some Android 14 features that have not been implemented correctly (why do I have to manually set refresh rates for all the apps even after selecting the high refresh rate option?) or are absent (where are the lock screen customisations?). OOS14 is still proving to be a good experience for me overall.I have not encountered any bugs in my day to day usage and every operation on the phone has been seamless so far. Honestly, I expected OP12 to be quite buggy at launch but I'm happy that they are learning from their mistakes.OP has managed to give great features in an extremely competitive price and I would say I'm mostly happy with my purchase (except maybe the camera). China models will see AI features soon and I hope global launches follow the suit."]

Predicted Sentiment: Positive

Review 2: ["Have been using the phone for over a week now.Positives:1. Snapdragon 782 processor is quite good. There is no lag whatsoever even on opening multiple apps and using for a long time.2. Battery life is decent. It is definitely not a gaming mobile.3. 5G services are accessible in most locations(in Hyderabad) wherever there is network.4. Both front and rear cameras are decent. You can click good shots in Night mode as well. Photos taken in various modes viz., Macro, Extra HD, Night, Pro, Potrait are attached.5. 80W fast charging is electric! I was able to charge my mobile from 23% to 100% in 17-18 mins and from 4% to 100% in 22-23 mins.6. Audio and video quality is great. Get some good earphones and you will experience the theatre effect with Dolby sound.7. No heating issue of any kind even after continuous usage/a long phone call.8. 12 GB RAM is great. You can now multitask and open apps simultaneously.Negatives:1. Battery drains fast. Should have been built to last longer. Like I said, definitely not a gamer's mobile. However, phone will last for a day even with heavy usage.2. Flagship 50MP Sony camera is a disappointment. Definitely not what an amateur photographer would expect. The moment you zoom in, image gets blurred and pixelated. Expected a much better camera from a mid premium mobile at priced at 30k3. Most of the features were toned down from other premium versions of OnePlus. However, one would expect some premium features when spending almost 30k.4. Back cover and screen guard are useless. Expected OnePlus to provide decent good quality default screen guard and phone cases. Please do buy both separately.5. Audio/Video seems to just stop and then play on using YouTube. Might have to update the app and check if it is an issue with the device.6. Absence of a 3.5mm audio jack is a big drawback for wired earphone users.Update 1 : Have received the first update to Oxygen 13.1 within 2-3 days of purchase wherein video quality of camera and few other features were improved. Also, the video lag issue is now resolved.Update 2: Received second software update on 23 Aug 2023 which is aimed at improving front/rear camera picture quality and optimizing the battery of the mobile when it is at rest.Update 3: Received another software upgrade in early October aimed at enhancing Network connectivity and stabilization.Update 4: Received Android 14 software upgrade on Jan 12 2024. Device is now stable.Overall a decent buy under 30k segment. Expected better features from a premium smartphone but certainly not a big disappointment. Overall 4 stars. I would recommend this mobile to others.", "Bought this phone for my wife and she's been using it for 3-4 days now. She has upgraded from the OnePlus 7, where as I use the OnePlus 9Pro.While setting up the phone for her and during basic usage of WhatsApp or Instagram, there's hardly any difference to the naked eye between this Nord 3 CE and other flagships. The display is solid, good colours. The fingerprint and face unlock are super fast. The haptic feedback while typing and navigation is very responsive. Oxygen OS 13 is stable and well optimised. Makes the experience of using this phone very smooth.Battery performance is excellent too. Goes from 10-80% in 25 mins. And a full 100% lasts 30-40 hours depending on usage.Camera is okay. Meant for those who have simple and basic usage. Video - OIS is average.The only thing I didn't like is the back cover. Feels very delicate. It's like a thin silicone-plastic layer, that's it. OnePlus should have used better material for the back to make the phone more sturdy. My mom has an old OnePlus Nord 2 CE Lite. Even that has a more sturdy back cover.Verdict: At 25k with back discount, this phone is phenomenal for the average user (priority is calls with everyday social media usage and browsing on Chrome). Performance, display, battery, OS are all pretty solid.But if you are a content creator who wishes to record high quality videos for making reels or YouTube videos, or your work needs you to continusly have your video on for Zoom meetings, then maybe, this phone is not for you. You'll need to consider investing in a better phone above the 35-40k price range.", 'I like this mobile overall good. 1 smooth display, 2.worth camera quality 3.look good design. BUT, 1. over Heating 2. fast battry drainWorth price ₹22k to ₹23', "About OnePlus Nord CE3, I would like to mention that the phone is more amazing than my expectations in all aspects except the quality of Camera. For that reason only I deduct one star and gave only 4 starts. I am writing this review after using this phone for almost a month. And the performance of the phone was exceptionally well thought out the period. I didn't find any difficulty in availing features of the phone. A little bit of heating caused due to heavy usage but it could be avoided, Battery backup is amazing, Display is very clear and colour contrast combination for watching movies and videos is also up to the mark, oxygen OS is performing well. I have updated software three times after purchasing it.This Phone has many good features though it lacks in camera quality and build quality. The main drawback of this phone is that it is not able to provide good quality optimised pictures outdoor and in night mode. You will get decent pictures with front camera but the not with the rear camera. The material used for its outer body doesn't seem to provide it a long term protection, it looks shining but quality of material could have been improved.Overall, I can say that Under this price range, this phone is one of the best options to buy. #OnePlus #Never Settle", "Post complain, the sensor gets reactive, but once the phone is idle for 30-40 sec, the sensor does not show up to unlock the phone. This is what I didn't like about this phone. On repeatly going to the service center they said things were fine and rejected my claim for a defective phone. Don't know what next to do. Other wise the phone is good to use. Being longer, one hand is difficult to use esp to navigate the top corner of the screen.", 'Nord CE3 5GI have been using this for 2 weeks now. All good- camera, voice/sound quality, speed & performance.Not happy with the battery backup, it drains out relatively fast. Fast charging works like a charm though.']

One thing is for sure, this Android phone is magic. Speed, Camera, display, battery back up and performance is simply unmatched for this device. People who have second choice after I phone. I strongly recommend this device. At this range and budget. One plus Nord strives to give the best to consumers. Blindly go for it.", "I recently upgraded to the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G in Pastel Lime, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Here's what I love about it:**Pros:**1. Affordable 5G: The inclusion of 5G capabilities in a phone at this price point is a huge plus. Streaming and downloading content is lightning-fast, and I'm future-proofed for upcoming advancements in connectivity.2. Sleek Design: The Pastel Lime color is unique and adds a refreshing touch to the device. The slim profile and lightweight build make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.3. Smooth Performance: With 8GB of RAM, multitasking is a breeze. The phone handles various apps and tasks simultaneously without any lag or slowdowns.4. Ample Storage: The 128GB storage provides enough room for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, the option to expand storage via microSD card is a thoughtful addition.5. Impressive Display: The AMOLED display offers vibrant colors and deep blacks, enhancing my media consumption experience. The Full HD+ resolution ensures crisp visuals, whether I'm watching videos or browsing the web.**Cons:**1. Average Camera Performance: While the camera setup is decent, it doesn't quite match the quality of flagship devices. Photos in well-lit conditions turn out great, but low-light performance could be improved.2. Plastic Back: While the plastic back keeps the device lightweight, it may not feel as premium as glass-backed phones. A good quality case helps mitigate this, though.3. Battery Life: The battery life is good, but not exceptional. It easily lasts me through a day of moderate use, but I'd appreciate a bit more juice for heavy usage days.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers a compelling package of features at an affordable price. It's a great option for users who want to experience 5G connectivity without breaking the bank. The design, performance, and display quality are its standout features, making it an excellent value for money.

Major- battery drain. The battery drain on this phone is a bit higher than average and also battery backup for a 5000mah battery is poor. It doesn't feel like this phone have a 5000mah power house. Minor- The back of the phone feels little bit warm sometimes ( very lesser amount of time ).Camera of the phone is awesome. Sound output is also good. No issues in display. Extremely happy with such low bezels but finding a perfect tempered glass for such a low bezel screen is a pain.Over-all, it's a decent buy if you're looking for a phone under 40K without curved screen. Oxygen OS/Color os is very user friendly and have all the features an average human askes for. Fingerprint scanner is a bit on the lower side of the screen but absolutely fast.

The battery lasts a day, Overall no complaints on any point except for the back design being so bland.", '', "The OnePlus Nord 3 Global version is a 🤌! I might say, the phone has some flagship qualities. If software updates can fix, tweak and boost the drawbacks...it will enter the flagship level.Pros: Beautiful and bright display (outdoor viewing is magnificent vs OPPO Find X5), Blazing fast charging (the same as the OPPO Find X5 Pro), impressive chipset (same SoC as the OPPO Find N2 flip), TUV certification for memory, very capable main camera (same as Oneplus 11), official IP rating despite being 54 only, longer and on time software support updates (3 years OS & 4 years security), & not bloatware-filled (deletable).Improvement suggestions: Longer on-screen battery life & better power efficiency (optimise software), better selfie and Ultra wide camera results, IP rating is 54 but could be better, the adaptive dynamic frame rate could be improved to reflect the claimed 40Hz or even down to 1Hz, WiFi 6E, Dual Wifi acceleration, eSim support.Overall, I would highly recommend especially if you want a phone under 1000 USD that's arguably flagship material! 💚OnePlus Australia also includes a free clear case and charger.
